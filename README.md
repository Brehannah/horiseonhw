# horiseonhw
In this assignment I had to refactor a webite called Horiseon. In the html file I added and corrected images, deleted extra <div>'s and tried to give the website a uniform appearence. Using my created style sheet file I changed the color of the website and and adjusted the sizing of  coloms.
